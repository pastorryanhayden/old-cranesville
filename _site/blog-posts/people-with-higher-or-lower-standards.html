                <h3>People With Higher or Lower Standards</h3>
                <p class="description"><strong>Posted On:</strong> November 18, 2015 • <strong>Author:</strong> Pastor Ryan Hayden • <strong>Category:</strong> Articles</p>
            </div><!--/entry-text-->
            <div class="entry-description">
                
                <p>Someone suggested that I write a follow up post to yesterday’s post on standards that talks about how to handle those with either stricter or looser standards than I personally hold.  I’m no expert on it, but it is something that I deal with every week and I imagine most Christians are in the same boat.</p>

<p>It’s my opinion that you deal with folks with a different standard on a case by case basis.  Essentially, whether they have more standards than I or less, there are only three cases I deal with and each one is handled differently:</p>

<h2 id="those-who-have-thought-through-their-standards">1.Those who have thought through their standards.</h2>

<h3 id="response-respect">Response: respect</h3>

<p>I have some friends who have worked through their position on standards.  They have thought through the point, source, use and cost of the standards they have adopted and come to a different conclusion than I.  Some of them are far more “conservative” than I am and some of them are far more “liberal” than I am, but in both cases I respect them.</p>

<p>People who have thought through their position don’t tend to be defensive.  They don’t tend to see questions as attacks.  They welcome the challenge of thinking and talking about them and they tend to be patient with people who don’t agree with them.</p>

<p>I respect guys like Kent Brandenburg and Bobby Mitchell, even though they are more conservative on some issues than me, because they’ve thought through their positions and don’t default to a hissy fit any time someone questions them.  On the flip side, I have local friends who don’t share my standards (on alcohol or Bible versions for example) and I respect them because they’ve thought through it.</p>

<h2 id="those-who-havent-thought-through-their-standards-and-are-cordial-about-it">2.Those who haven’t thought through their standards and are cordial about it.</h2>

<h3 id="response-patience-and-instruction">Response: patience and instruction</h3>

<p>Most people I meet are in this category, even though they probably don’t know it.  They aren’t jerks.  Most of the time they are probably doing what they are doing with pure motives.  They just haven’t thought through it.</p>

<p>The apostle Paul asked the Corinthian believers “For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?” In other words, all of us are building on other people’s foundations.  All of us have to thank God for the position we are in.  It’s a dangerous thing to look down on others for their position without taking into account that, probably, much of that position (like ours) was shaped by their context.  In other words, they didn’t choose the church they were saved in, the part of the country they lived in, who their influences are.  All of that is providential and it makes a HUGE impact on their beliefs. Very often, when people haven’t thought through an issue and yet have a position on it, they are being manipulated by someone else and don’t realize it.  Remembering this makes it easier to be patient with people.</p>

<p>When it comes to talking to these people, I generally take it very, very slow.  Also, I’m careful to not flaunt my looser standards (if theirs are stricter) or browbeat them with my stricter standards (if theirs are looser).  I preach the scripture and let the Holy Spirit do His work in their hearts.</p>

<h2 id="those-who-havent-thought-through-their-standards-and-are-a-jerk-about-it">3.Those who haven’t thought through their standards and are a jerk about it.</h2>

<h3 id="response-pity">Response: Pity</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, there are many people who have very simplistic reasons for why they do what they do and they are straight up mean about it.  They either look down on you for being too loose or look down on you for being too strict.  They are quick with words like “liberal” and “compromiser” or, if they are on the other end of the spectrum “legalist.”</p>

<p>It’s my opinion that most of the time this type of person is struggling with insecurity.  Not only are they not thinking for themselves, they CAN’T think for themselves or (in their mind) their entire world would crumble around them.  Almost always these people are either manipulated by others, or are manipulating others and are afraid that would come to light.  Their belief system is built on such a shaky foundation that it cannot endure even the slightest wind of questioning so they set up like a sentry and shoot at anyone who even comes close.</p>

<p>I don’t hate such people, I pity them.</p>
