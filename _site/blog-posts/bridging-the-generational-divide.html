                <h3>Bridging the Generational Divide</h3>
                <p class="description"><strong>Posted On:</strong> December 2, 2015 • <strong>Author:</strong> Pastor Ryan Hayden • <strong>Category:</strong> Articles</p>

            <div class="entry-description">
                
                <p>This week, I officiated a funeral. At the funeral I met a man who was celebrating his 90th birthday. This guy was awesome. He was sharp as a tack. He didn’t look a day over 70 and he was actually at the funeral because he was working part time for the funeral home.</p>

<p>We had some time so I talked to him about a good many things. He flew B-25s in World War 2, was a farmer for many years, and had recently taken up the piano. At some point along the way, he told me that he enjoyed playing Elvis songs for his grandchildren.</p>

<p>Then it hit me: <em>This man was in his thirties before Elvis was even a thing.</em></p>

<h3 id="his-life">His life</h3>

<p>As I thought about it some more, I got to think about how many other things he had lived through: He was in his forties during the Vietnam war and hippy age. He was in his sixties before personal computers were a thing and in his seventies before any normal person was on the internet.</p>

<p>The more I thought about it, the more I thought that this man and those of his generation may have lived through more social changes than any other generation in human history. I’ve often wondered what it would be like to have your life span the end of slavery, the industrial revolution or the protestant reformation - I think the 20th century might have even been more of a radical shift than even those crazy times.</p>

<p>Many of those changes were good: the end of racism, the explosion of wealth, the onset of easy travel, the spread of information, the eradication of diseases like polio, etc. However, many of those changes were things we would consider bad: a sharp uptick in divorce rates, the rejection of traditional (and biblical) gender roles, the increase in children born out of wedlock, the rise of adolescence and youth culture, the institutionalization of teenaged rebellion - the list could go on and on.</p>

<h3 id="my-life">My Life</h3>

<p>From that perspective, think about someone like me. I was born in 1983. I never lived in a culture where it was scandalous for a woman to wear pants at Wal-mart or for a man to wear only a t-shirt. 75% of my class in high school had divorced parents. In the broader culture, rock music was never a sign of generational rebellion (my dad played U2 over my cradle.) I was tinkering with computers in grade school and on the internet (albeit the old AOL variety) in middle school.</p>

<p>This man grew up listening to “The Shadow” on the one family radio. I grew up watching Teenaged Mutant Ninja Turtles and Ghostbusters on my own TV in the playroom (When I wasn’t playing on the Nintendo or Sega Genesis). This man had the run of the family farm. I was told to stay in the back yard. This man was expected to be married between 21-23 and to father children before 30. I had many well meaning people say “but you’re so young” when I was married at 23.</p>

<p>Truly the only world I’ve ever known is completely different than the world he spent most of his life in.</p>

<h1 id="the-three-groups-in-our-churches">The Three Groups In Our Churches</h1>

<p>We are truly living at a unique time in human history. Life spans are longer than they have ever been and, coupled with the seismic cultural shift of the last 60 years, it creates a very interesting dynamic.</p>

<p>Essentially, you have three groups in churches today:</p>

<p>First, there are those like the man I met the other day who lived most of their lives in “the good old days.” I’ll call them The Old Timers. Their view of culture tends to be traditional and nostalgic.</p>

<p>Second, there are those like me who were born after the cultural revolution. Let call them The New Kids. We tend to look at a lot of the cultural changes and have a hard time getting as worked up about them because we’ve never known anything different.</p>

<p>Third, there are those who make up the transitional generations between the Old Timers and the New Kids. Let’s call them The Transitionals. Their perspectives on cultural issues vary widely and whatever their position, they tend to be sympathetic to both The Old Timers and the New Kids.</p>

<p>Chances are you have Old Timers, Transitionals and New Kids in your church. Chances are also pretty good that your church has been dominated by Old Timers and the kind of transitionals who were (I think rightly) very slow to accept cultural change. Chances are leadership in your church has either been passed on to someone from my generation or is in the process of being passed on and you are working through what that means.</p>

<h1 id="what-do-we-do">What Do We Do?</h1>

<p>I wish I could give you some special insight on how to handle this. I can’t. I’m still working it out myself. But there are three things I wish all of us would put into practice in our churches when it comes to this generational stuff:</p>

<h2 id="recognition">Recognition</h2>

<p>Just recognize that a potential generational struggle is there. Knowing how rapid the culture has shifted, how rare it is for their to be three almost completely different cultures sharing the same church and how vast the generation gap can potentially be helps all three groups not to jump to conclusions.</p>

<h2 id="empathy">Empathy</h2>

<p>Before we as young people jump to conclusions about “old timers” lets consider how much social upheaval they’ve lived through. Let’s do our best to give them the benefit of the doubt and to judge them in the light of their generational context.</p>

<p>Similarly, as one of the New Kids myself, I would beg both the Transitionals and the Old Timers to think about our generational context a little bit. We were not raised in the same world that you were and we cannot be expected to swallow all of the same assumptions about culture that you got by proxy. Instead of losing your minds whenever we see cultural issues differently than you do, expect that and help us see what your experience and accumulated wisdom brings to bear on the subject.</p>

<h2 id="respect">Respect</h2>

<p>The Bible tells us in no uncertain terms that we are to respect our elders and “the hoary head.” We live in a time and culture when age is despised and where some church growth experts straight up call for the input of the Old Timers to be ignored in the name of reaching the next generation. Despite the difficulties that our unique generational context gives us - let’s strive to show a great amount of respect and deference for those who went before.</p>
